    <h2 id="the-what-and-why-of-open-source">The “what” and “why” of Code Challenge</h2>
<p>So you’re thinking about jumping in with our Code Challenges? Congratulations! The world appreciates your contribution.  We know we can't do it alone and we understand the need to get great help from developers like you who understands equity and domain partnership or ownership if its on the table.</>
	
<p>
</p>


<h3 id="what-does-open-source-mean">What is Code Challenge</h3>

<p>CODEChallenge is geared for coders, development companies that simply would like to contribute for some equity or part ownership or stake in the domains that are added in the code challenges.</p>

<p>If you join our community, you will be bombarded with words like Contrib, and frameworks. Contrib is our contribution network and where we allow people to contribute to a specific project or domain. </p>
<p>All our domains are run on frameworks. They are considered open source and is available on our github and docker pages. But don't go there for now. We need you to understand how to join and be a part of Code Challenge online bootcamp.</p>
<p>So if Contrib runs the contribution part, and domains run on frameworks, what is your part?</p>
<p>Your part is to help us on any of the frameworks we place on Code Challenge and make it better, make it useable not just for our company but for all.</p>
<h3 id="why-do-people-open-source-their-work">Why would you want to Contrib?</h3>

  One of the most rewarding experiences I get out of using and collaborating on open source comes from the relationships that I build with other developers facing many of the same problems I am.</p>

  </p>
</aside>

<p>There are many reasons why you would want to contribute.</p>

<p>The consensus, it seems, is that it's only fair to pay your friends in the community back by making improvements wherever you see them. After all, the developers of the open source world put the considerable efforts of their friends to work in their own software every single day.</p>

<p>And the net result is that your choice for a better way of doing things becomes even better, constantly. </p>

<h2 id="should-i-launch-my-own-open-source-project">How to Contrib?</h2>

<p>You have to have a github profile account so if you have'nt signed up, then I think now is the time for you to build your <a href="http://www.github.com">Github profile</a></p>

<p>Next please create a developer account at <a href="http://developers.contrib.com">Developers.Contrib.com</a></p>
<p>Then follow these simple steps below.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will find all code challenges on the Challenges page and their accompanying Github or Docker link.</li>
<li>Fork or clone the framework you want to dabble or Contrib to.</li>
<li>Fork in github or clone in Docker</li>
<li>Submit your entries on the accompanying folder on the Challenges page. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="launching-your-own-open-source-project">Launching your own open source project</h2>

<p>There is no perfect time to open source your work. You can open source an idea, a work in progress, or after years of being closed source.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, you should open source your project when you feel comfortable having others view, and give feedback on, your work.</p>

<p>No matter which stage you decide to open source your project, every project should include the following documentation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/open-source-licensing/#where-does-the-license-live-on-my-repository">Open source license</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/#commit-your-first-change">README</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors/">Contributing guidelines</a></li>
  <li><a href="../code-of-conduct/">Code of conduct</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As a maintainer, these components will help you communicate expectations, manage contributions, and protect everyone’s legal rights (including your own). They significantly increase your chances of having a positive experience.</p>

<p>If your project is on GitHub, putting these files in your root directory with the recommended filenames will help GitHub recognize and automatically surface them to your readers.</p>

<h3 id="choosing-a-license">Choosing a license</h3>

<p>An open source license guarantees that others can use, copy, modify, and contribute back to your project without repercussions. It also protects you from sticky legal situations. <strong>You must include a license when you launch an open source project.</strong></p>

<p>Legal work is no fun. The good news is that you can copy and paste an existing license into your repository. It will only take a minute to protect your hard work.</p>

<p><a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/">MIT</a>, <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/">Apache 2.0</a>, and <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/">GPLv3</a> are the most popular open source licenses, but <a href="https://choosealicense.com">there are other options</a> to choose from.</p>

<p>When you create a new project on GitHub, you are given the option to select a license. Including an open source license will make your GitHub project open source.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/starting-a-project/repository-license-picker.png" alt="pick a license"></p>

<p>If you have other questions or concerns around the legal aspects of managing an open source project, <a href="../legal/">we’ve got you covered</a>.</p>

<h3 id="writing-a-readme">Writing a README</h3>

<p>READMEs do more than explain how to use your project. They also explain why your project matters, and what your users can do with it.</p>

<p>In your README, try to answer the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What does this project do?</li>
  <li>Why is this project useful?</li>
  <li>How do I get started?</li>
  <li>Where can I get more help, if I need it?</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use your README to answer other questions, like how you handle contributions, what the goals of the project are, and information about licenses and attribution. If you don’t want to accept contributions, or your project is not yet ready for production, write this information down.</p>

<aside class="pquote">

  Better documentation means more users, less support requests, and more contributors. (…) Remember that your readers aren’t you. There are people who might come to a project who have completely different experiences.</p>
  <p class="pquote-credit">

  </p>
</aside>

<p>Sometimes, people avoid writing a README because they feel like the project is unfinished, or they don’t want contributions. These are all very good reasons to write one.</p>

<p>For more inspiration, try using <a href="https://github.com/18F" class="user-mention">@18F</a>’s <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/open-source-guide/making-readmes-readable/">“Making READMEs Readable”</a> or <a href="https://github.com/PurpleBooth" class="user-mention">@PurpleBooth</a>’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2">README template</a> to write a complete README.</p>

<p>When you include a README file in the root directory, GitHub will automatically display it on the repository homepage.</p>

<h3 id="writing-your-contributing-guidelines">Writing your contributing guidelines</h3>

<p>A CONTRIBUTING file tells your audience how to participate in your project. For example, you might include information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to file a bug report (try using <a href="https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates">issue and pull request templates</a>)</li>
  <li>How to suggest a new feature</li>
  <li>How to set up your environment and run tests</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to technical details, a CONTRIBUTING file is an opportunity to communicate your expectations for contributions, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The types of contributions you’re looking for</li>
  <li>Your roadmap or vision for the project</li>
  <li>How contributors should (or should not) get in touch with you</li>
</ul>

<p>Using a warm, friendly tone and offering specific suggestions for contributions (such as writing documentation, or making a website) can go a long way in making newcomers feel welcomed and excited to participate.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/">Active Admin</a> starts <a href="https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">its contributing guide</a> with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First off, thank you for considering contributing to Active Admin. It’s people like you that make Active Admin such a great tool.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the earliest stages of your project, your CONTRIBUTING file can be simple. You should always explain how to report bugs or file issues, and any technical requirements (like tests) to make a contribution.</p>

<p>Over time, you might add other frequently asked questions to your CONTRIBUTING file. Writing down this information means fewer people will ask you the same questions over and over again.</p>

<p>For more help with writing your CONTRIBUTING file, check out <a href="https://github.com/nayafia" class="user-mention">@nayafia</a>’s <a href="https://github.com/nayafia/contributing-template/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING-template.md">contributing guide template</a> or <a href="https://github.com/mozilla" class="user-mention">@mozilla</a>’s <a href="http://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/contributing/">“How to Build a CONTRIBUTING.md”</a>.</p>

<p>Link to your CONTRIBUTING file from your README, so more people see it. If you <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors/">place the CONTRIBUTING file in your project’s repository</a>, GitHub will automatically link to your file when a contributor creates an issue or opens a pull request.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/starting-a-project/Contributing-guidelines.jpg" alt="contributing guidelines"></p>

<h3 id="establishing-a-code-of-conduct">Establishing a code of conduct</h3>

<aside class="pquote">
  <p><img src="https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/11214?v=3&amp;s=460" class="pquote-avatar" alt="avatar">
  We’ve all had experiences where we faced what was probably abuse either as a maintainer trying to explain why something had to be a certain way, or as a user…asking a simple question. (…) A code of conduct becomes an easily referenced and linkable document that indicates that your team takes constructive discourse very seriously.</p>
  <p class="pquote-credit">
— <a href="https://github.com/mlynch" class="user-mention">@mlynch</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/ionic-and-the-mobile-web/making-open-source-a-happier-place-3b90d254f5f#.v4qhl7t7v">“Making Open Source a Happier Place”</a>
  </p>
</aside>

<p>Finally, a code of conduct helps set ground rules for behavior for your project’s participants. This is especially valuable if you’re launching an open source project for a community or company. A code of conduct empowers you to facilitate healthy, constructive community behavior, which will reduce your stress as a maintainer.</p>

<p>For more information, check out our <a href="../code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct guide</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to communicating <em>how</em> you expect participants to behave, a code of conduct also tends to describe who these expectations apply to, when they apply, and what to do if a violation occurs.</p>

<p>Much like open source licenses, there are also emerging standards for codes of conduct, so you don’t have to write your own. The <a href="http://contributor-covenant.org/">Contributor Covenant</a> is a drop-in code of conduct that is used by <a href="http://contributor-covenant.org/adopters/">over 40,000 open source projects</a>, including Kubernetes, Rails, and Swift. No matter which text you use, you should be prepared to enforce your code of conduct when necessary.</p>

<p>Paste the text directly into a CODE_OF_CONDUCT file in your repository. Keep the file in your project’s root directory so it’s easy to find, and link to it from your README.</p>

<h2 id="naming-and-branding-your-project">Naming and branding your project</h2>

<p>Branding is more than a flashy logo or catchy project name. It’s about how you talk about your project, and who you reach with your message.</p>

<h3 id="choosing-the-right-name">Choosing the right name</h3>

<p>Pick a name that is easy to remember and, ideally, gives some idea of what the project does. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry">Sentry</a> monitors apps for crash reporting</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/macournoyer/thin">Thin</a> is a fast and simple Ruby web server</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re building upon an existing project, using their name as a prefix can help clarify what your project does (ex. <a href="https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch">node-fetch</a> brings <code class="highlighter-rouge">window.fetch</code> to Node.js).</p>

<p>Consider clarity above all. Puns are fun, but remember that some jokes might not translate to other cultures or people with different experiences from you. Some of your potential users might be company employees: you don’t want to make them uncomfortable when they have to explain your project at work!</p>

<h3 id="avoiding-name-conflicts">Avoiding name conflicts</h3>

<p>Check for open source projects with a similar name, especially if you share the same language or ecosystem. If your name overlaps with a popular existing project, you might confuse your audience.</p>

<p>If you want a website, Twitter handle, or other properties to represent your project, make sure you can get the names you want. Ideally, <a href="https://instantdomainsearch.com/">reserve those names now</a> for peace of mind, even if you don’t intend to use them just yet.</p>

<p>Make sure that your project’s name doesn’t infringe upon any trademarks. A company might ask you to take down your project later on, or even take legal action against you. It’s just not worth the risk.</p>

<p>You can check the <a href="http://www.wipo.int/branddb/en/">WIPO Global Brand Database</a> for trademark conflicts. If you’re at a company, this is one of the things your <a href="../legal/">legal team can help you with</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, do a quick Google search for your project name. Will people be able to easily find your project? Does something else appear in the search results that you wouldn’t want them to see?</p>

<h3 id="how-you-write-and-code-affects-your-brand-too">How you write (and code) affects your brand, too!</h3>

<p>Throughout the life of your project, you’ll do a lot of writing: READMEs, tutorials, community documents, responding to issues, maybe even newsletters and mailing lists.</p>

<p>Whether it’s official documentation or a casual email, your writing style is part of your project’s brand. Consider how you might come across to your audience and whether that is the tone you wish to convey.</p>

<aside class="pquote">
  <p><img src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=3&amp;s=460" class="pquote-avatar" alt="avatar">
  I tried to be involved with every thread on the mailing list, and showing exemplary behaviour, being nice to people, taking their issues seriously and trying to be helpful overall. After a while, people stuck around not to only ask questions, but to help with the answering as well, and to my complete delight, they mimicked my style.</p>

  </p>
</aside>

<p>Using warm, inclusive language (such as “them”, even when referring to the single person) can go a long way in making your project feel welcoming to new contributors. Stick to simple language, as many of your readers may not be native English speakers.</p>

<p>Beyond how you write words, your coding style may also become part of your project’s brand. <a href="https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide">Angular</a> and <a href="http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/">jQuery</a> are two examples of projects with rigorous coding styles and guidelines.</p>

<p>It isn’t necessary to write a style guide for your project when you’re just starting out, and you may find that you enjoy incorporating different coding styles into your project anyway. But you should anticipate how your writing and coding style might attract or discourage different types of people. The earliest stages of your project are your opportunity to set the precedent you wish to see.</p>
